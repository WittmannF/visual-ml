### Visual ML Issues and Limitations

- The input set of features shoudl be a Pandas Dataframe
- When 1D the column should be declared as a string, not a list ('col_name' instead of ['col_name'])
- The target variable has to be binary and either True/False or 1/0. 
    - Support to regression and multiclassification can be implemented in the future
- The training and testing set can't be visualized as different sets.

- Histogram colors are sometimes inverted
- The Python code could be more elegant and robust
